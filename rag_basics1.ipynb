       "'ChatGPT is a generative artificial intelligence chatbot developed by OpenAI and launched in 2022. It is currently based on the GPT-4o large language model (LLM). ChatGPT can generate human-like conversational responses and enables users to refine and steer a conversation towards a desired length, format, style, level of detail, and language. It is credited with accelerating the AI boom, which has led to ongoing rapid investment in and public attention to the field of artificial intelligence (AI). Some observers have raised concern about the potential of ChatGPT and similar programs to displace human intelligence, enable plagiarism, or fuel misinformation.\\nBy January 2023, ChatGPT had become what was then the fastest-growing consumer software application in history, gaining over 100 million users in two months and contributing to the growth of OpenAI\\'s current valuation of $86 billion. ChatGPT\\'s release spurred the release of competing products, including Gemini, Claude, Llama, Ernie, and Grok. Microsoft launched Copilot, initially based on OpenAI\\'s GPT-4. In May 2024, a partnership between Apple Inc. and OpenAI was announced, in which ChatGPT was integrated into the Apple Intelligence feature of Apple operating systems. As of July 2024, ChatGPT\\'s website is among the 10 most-visited websites globally.\\nChatGPT is built on OpenAI\\'s proprietary series of generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) models and is fine-tuned for conversational applications using a combination of supervised learning and reinforcement learning from human feedback. Successive user prompts and replies are considered at each conversation stage as context. ChatGPT was released as a freely available research preview, but due to its popularity, OpenAI now operates the service on a freemium model. Users on its free tier can access GPT-4o. The ChatGPT subscriptions \"Plus\", \"Team\", and \"Enterprise\" provide additional features such as DALL-E 3 image generation and an increased usage limit.\\n\\n\\n== Training ==\\n\\nChatGPT is based on particular GPT foundation models, namely GPT-4, GPT-4o and GPT-4o mini, that were fine-tuned to target conversational usage. The fine-tuning process leveraged supervised learning and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Both approaches employed human trainers to improve model performance. In the case of supervised learning, the trainers played both sides: the user and the AI assistant. In the reinforcement learning stage, human trainers first ranked responses that the model had created in a previous conversation. These rankings were used to create \"reward models\" that were used to fine-tune the model further by using several iterations of proximal policy optimization.\\nTime magazine revealed that to build a safety system against harmful content (e.g., sexual abuse, violence, racism, sexism), OpenAI used outsourced Kenyan workers earning less than $2 per hour to label harmful content. These labels were used to train a model to detect such content in the future. The outsourced laborers were exposed to \"toxic\" and traumatic content; one worker described the assignment as \"torture\". OpenAI\\'s outsourcing partner was Sama, a training-data company based in San Francisco, California.\\nChatGPT initially used a Microsoft Azure supercomputing infrastructure, powered by Nvidia GPUs, that Microsoft built specifically for OpenAI and that reportedly cost \"hundreds of millions of dollars\". Following ChatGPT\\'s success, Microsoft dramatically upgraded the OpenAI infrastructure in 2023. Scientists at the University of California, Riverside, estimate that a series of prompts to ChatGPT needs approximately 500 milliliters (18 imp fl oz; 17 U.S. fl oz) of water for Microsoft servers cooling. TrendForce market intelligence estimated that 30,000 Nvidia GPUs (each costing approximately $10,000–15,000) were used to power ChatGPT in 2023.\\nOpenAI collects data from ChatGPT users to train and fine-tune the service further. Users can upvote or downvote respon'"
